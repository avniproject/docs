## Introduction

### What is Metabase?

Metabase is a powerful open-source analytics and visualization tool that Avni integrates to provide comprehensive reporting capabilities. It allows you to create custom dashboards, run ad-hoc queries, and share insights across your organization with simple drag-and-drop operations.

### Self-Service Reports in Avni

Self-service Reports is a feature in Avni that allows users to create and manage reports without requiring technical expertise. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating and managing reports, and allows users to schedule and distribute reports via email.  
In Avni, we make use of Metabase to power Self-Service Reports.

> **Note:** This guide provides comprehensive documentation for setup, user management, and administration of Self-Service Reports. For hands-on training with practical exercises for using Metabase on your Avni Data, please refer to the [Getting started with Avni Metabase reports](getting-started-with-avni-reports) guide.

### Benefits of Metabase

- **User-friendly interface**: Create visualizations with simple drag-and-drop operations
- **Customizable dashboards**: Build tailored views for different stakeholders
- **Automated reporting**: Schedule and distribute reports via email
- **Data exploration**: Empower users to find insights without technical expertise
- **Secure access control**: Manage permissions at granular levels

### Inbuilt Capabilities of Self-Service Reports

Self-service Reports in Avni provides the following capabilities:

1. Creates a dedicated database user with appropriate permissions
2. Establishes a connection between Metabase and your Avni database

## Setup Process

### 1. Enabling Self-Service Reports

Self-Service Reports is managed at the organization level in Avni:

1. Log in to your Avni webapp
2. Navigate to Reports section
3. Click on "Self-service Reports" tab
4. Click on "Setup Reports" button

![Initial Setup State](https://files.readme.io/cdaa0376b8d1b7fbe8a1d776681b23a8f4643cbbc44c290888e5fcf356b23dd4-metabase_initial_state.png)  
_Figure 2: Initial state before Self-Service Reports setup with "Setup Reports" button_

### 2. Setup Process Stages

The setup process goes through several stages:

#### Initial Setup

When you first enable Self-Service Reports, you'll see the "Setup Reports" button. Clicking this button initiates the setup process.

#### Setup in Progress

During the setup process, you'll see a loading indicator:

![Setup in Progress](https://files.readme.io/34792bee15afc7e3ddf4a88a31e62ba4c23a8131971377c52df7a81c624c599d-metabase_loading_state.png)  
_Figure 3: Setup in progress with loading spinner_

The setup process typically takes 15-30 minutes to complete and involves:

- Database connection setup
- Initial schema synchronization
- Permission configuration
- Default Collection and Dashboard creation
- Default questions creation

#### Partial Setup

Sometimes, the setup may complete partially with only some resources available:

![Partial Setup](https://files.readme.io/61242bf6bcce5582259ac4ba46363b9cd90a102be6511728d18b6623e4417ada-metabase_partial_setup.png)  
_Figure 4.a: Partial setup with only Database resource available_

In this state, you can either:

- Wait for the remaining resources to be created automatically
- Click "Setup Reports" again to retry the setup process

### 3. Verifying Setup Completion

You can verify the setup was successful by:

1. Confirming the "Explore Your Data" button is available
2. Testing access with a user that has been added to the "Metabase Users" group in Avni

## User Management

### User Group Synchronization

Avni automatically synchronizes users between the Avni platform and Metabase. This synchronization ensures that users added to the "Metabase Users" group in Avni can access analytics in Metabase.

#### Adding Users in Avni

To grant users access to Metabase analytics:

1. Navigate to User Groups Management in Avni Admin App
2. Select the "Metabase Users" group
3. Add the user(s) you want to grant access to the group
4. Save changes
5. User added to "Metabase Users" group, will receive an email with an account activation link

Note: Removing users from the "Metabase Users" group will remove their access to Metabase analytics.

![Avni User Groups](https://files.readme.io/5c483f0cd5480029f298a23961dfb5248f633d13195022546bc8af4248cddac7-metabase_user_groups.png)_Figure 5: Avni user groups management interface showing Metabase Users group_

#### Verification in Metabase

After adding users to the Metabase Users group in Avni, you can verify their synchronization in the Metabase admin interface:

![Metabase Admin People](https://files.readme.io/cf18e6606710fc311495adec917571095ba46e793afadd92e731a17f192fdaf1-metabase_admin_people.png)_Figure 6: Metabase Admin interface showing synchronized users_

The synchronization process:

1. Creates user accounts in Metabase with the same email addresses as in Avni
2. Includes the User in Metabase Group corresponding to their organization

## Navigation
