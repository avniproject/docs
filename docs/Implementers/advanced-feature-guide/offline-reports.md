Avni allows you to create different indicator reports that are available offline to the field users. These reports help field users to derive more insights on the captured data. 

Creating an offline report is a two-step process. First, we need to create a report card that holds the actual query function. Second, we group multiple cards into to a dashboard.

## Creating a Report Card

Creating a new report card is no different than creating any other Avni entity. Open app designer and go to the report card tab. Click on the new report card and provide the details like name description, etc.

### Report Card Types

Report cards can be of 2 types - 'Standard' and 'Custom'. The logic used to display the values in 'Standard' type cards are already implemented in Avni whereas the logic needs to be written by the implementer for 'Custom' type cards.

1. Standard Report Cards, the different types of which are as follows (Entity specified in brackets indicates the type of entity listed on clicking on the card):

   - Pending approval (Entity Approval Statuses)

   - Approved (Entity Approval Statuses)

   - Rejected (Entity Approval Statuses)

   - Scheduled visits (Subjects)

   - Overdue visits (Subjects)

   - Recent registrations (Subjects)

   - Recent enrolments (Subjects)

   - Recent visits (Subjects)

   - Total (Subjects)

   - Comments (Subjects)

   - Call tasks (Tasks)

   - Open subject tasks (Tasks)

   - Due checklist (Individuals)

   [block:image]{"images":[{"image":["https://files.readme.io/5093034-Screenshot_2023-12-11_at_4.55.48_PM.png","",""],"align":"center"}]}[/block]
2. Custom Report cards: Report card with configurable **Query**, which returns a list of Individuals as the response. Length of the list is shown on the card and on clicking the card, the list of Individuals returned is shown. Please note that the query function can return a list of Individuals or an object with these properties, ` { primaryValue: '20', secondaryValue: '(5%)',  lineListFunction  }`, here `lineListFunction` should always return the list of subjects.

#### Standard Report Card Type Filters

Filters can be added at the report card level for certain standard report types. The following filters are supported:

1. Subject Type
2. Program
3. Encounter Type
4. Recent Duration

Subject Type, Program and Encounter Type filters are supported for 'Overdue Visits', 'Scheduled Visits', 'Total' and 'Recent' types ('Recent registrations', 'Recent enrolments', 'Recent visits').

![](https://files.readme.io/c2f3eb0a468c1e8e3efb808ccb831cf87e19c5da5ba92ae9ed99a0af619d528f-image.png) 

<br />

Filters can also be configured at the dashboard level (covered below). If a filter is configured both at the report card level and the dashboard level, the filter at the report card level is applied first. Hence, mixing of the same type of filter at both levels should be avoided as it could lead to the unintuitive behaviour of the field user selecting a value, say 'Household' for the subject type filter at the dashboard level but still seeing the numbers for the 'Individual' subject type which is configured at the report card level.

## Creating a Dashboard

After all the cards are done it's time to group them together using the dashboard. Offline Dashboards have the following sub-components:

- Sections : Visual Partitions used to club together cards of specific grouping type
- Offline (Custom) Report Cards : Usually Clickable blocks with count information about grouping of Individuals or EntityApprovals of specific type
- Filters : Configurable filters that get applied to all "Report Cards" count and listing

Users with access to the "App Designer" can Create, Modifiy or Delete Custom Dashboards as seen below. 

![](https://files.readme.io/824878a-image.png)

### Steps to configure a Custom Dashboard

- Click on the dashboard tab on the app designer and click on the new dashboard.
- This will take you to the new dashboard screen. Provide the name and description of the dashboard.
- You can create sections on this screen and
- Select all the cards you need to add to the section in the dashboard.
- After adding all the cards, you can re-arrange the cards in the order you want them to see in the field app.

### Dashboard Filters

You can also create filters for a dashboard on the same screen by clicking on "Add Filter". This shows a popup as in the below screenshot where you can configure your filter and set the filter name, type, widget type and other values based on your filter type.

![](https://files.readme.io/91f1aa1-image.png)

Once all the changes are done. Save the dashboard.

#### For the filters to be applied to the cards in the dashboard, the code for the cards will need to handle the filters.

Sample Code for handling filters in report card:

```
'use strict';
({params, imports}) => {
//console.log('------>',params.ruleInput.filter( type => type.Name === "Gender" ));
//console.log("params:::", JSON.stringify(params.ruleInput));
  let individualList = params.db.objects('Individual').filtered("voided = false and subjectType.name = 'Individual'" )
     .filter( (individual) => individual.getAgeInYears() >= 18 && individual.getAgeInYears() <= 49  &&  individual.getObservationReadableValue('Is sterilisation done') === 'No');
  
  if (params.ruleInput) {

       let genderFilter = params.ruleInput.filter(rule => rule.type === "Gender");
       let genderValue = genderFilter[0].filterValue[0].name;
      
        console.log('genderFilter---------',genderFilter);
        console.log('genderValue---------',genderValue);        
        
      return individualList
     .filter( (individual) => {
     console.log("individual.gender:::", JSON.stringify(individual.gender.name));
     return individual.gender.name === genderValue;
     });
     }
     else return individualList;
};
```

### Assigning custom Dashboards to User Groups

Custom Dashboards created need to be assigned specifically to a User Group, in-order for Users to see it on the Avni-client mobile app. You may do this, by navigating to the "Admin" app -> "User Groups" -> (User_GROUP) -> "Dashboards" tab, and assigning one or more Custom Dashboards to a User-Group.

In addition, You can also mark one of these Custom Dashboards as the Primary (Is Primary: True) dashboard from the "Admin" app -> "User Groups" -> (User_GROUP) -> "Dashboards".

## Using the Dashboard in the Field App

After saving the dashboard sync the field app, and from the bottom "More" tab click on the "Dashboards" option. It will take you to the dashboard screen and will show all the cards that are added to the dashboard.

      "sizing": "400px",
      "caption": "Report cards  returning `primaryValue` and `secondaryValue` object"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


Clicking any card will take the user to the subject listing page, which will display all the subject names returned by the card query.

        ""
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "400px"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


Users can click on any subject and navigate to their dashboard.

## Secondary Dashboard

### Web app configuration

As part of Avni release 8.0.0, a new feature of a secondary dashboard is added which can be configured at user group level to populate an additional option on the Avni mobile app bottom drawer to navigate to a secondary dashboard. This configuration has to be done in the user group in Avni web app. 

- By navigating to the dashboard section in a particular user group where dashboards can be added to user groups, the secondary dashboard can be defined apart from the home dashboard. As shown in the screenshot below, any dashboard can be selected as the secondary dashboard.

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "15px"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


### Secondary dashboard in mobile app

The configuration mentioned above would display the particular dashboard in the mobile app as given below. This would allow users to access the home and secondary dashboard from the bottom drawer of the mobile app instead of navigating to the more page.

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "400px"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


### Clash in Dashboards configuration across different UserGroups

In-case a User belongs to multiple UserGroups, where-in each has a different Primary and/or Secondary Dashboards, then the behaviour is undeterministic. I.e, any of the possible Primary Dashboards across the various UserGroups, would show up as the Primary on the app. Similar behaviour should be expected of the Secondary Dashboard as well.

## Report card query example

As mentioned earlier query can return a list of Individuals or an object with properties, ` { primaryValue: '20', secondaryValue: '(5%)',  lineListFunction  }`. DB instance is passed using the params and useful libraries like lodash and moment are available in the imports parameter of the function. Below are some examples of writing the `lineListFunction`.

The below function returns a list of pregnant women having any high-risk conditions.

```javascript High risk condition women
'use strict';
({params, imports}) => {
    const isHighRiskWomen = (enrolment) => {
        const weight = enrolment.findLatestObservationInEntireEnrolment('Weight');
        const hb = enrolment.findLatestObservationInEntireEnrolment('Hb');
        const numberOfLiveChildren = enrolment.findLatestObservationInEntireEnrolment('Number of live children');
        return (weight && weight.getReadableValue() < 40) || (hb && hb.getReadableValue() < 8) ||
            (numberOfLiveChildren && numberOfLiveChildren.getReadableValue() > 3)
    };
    return {
      lineListFunction: () => params.db.objects('Individual')
        .filtered(`SUBQUERY(enrolments, $enrolment, SUBQUERY($enrolment.encounters, $encounter, $encounter.encounterType.name = 'Monthly monitoring of pregnant woman' and $encounter.voided = false).@count > 0 and $enrolment.voided = false and voided = false).@count > 0`)
        .filter((individual) => individual.voided === false && _.some(individual.enrolments, (enrolment) => enrolment.program.name === 'Pregnant Woman' && isHighRiskWomen(enrolment)))
    }
};
```

It is important to write optimised query and load very less data in memory for processing. There will be the cases where query can't be written in realm and we need to load the data in memory, but remember more data we load into the memory slower will be the reports. As an example consider below two cases, in the first case we directly query realm to fetch all the individuals enrolled in Child program, but in the second case we first load all individuals into memory and then filter those cases. 

```javascript Query in Realm context (better performance)
'use strict';
({params, imports}) => ({
    lineListFunction: () => params.db.objects('Individual')
        .filtered(`SUBQUERY(enrolments, $enrolment, $enrolment.program.name = 'Child' and voided = false).@count > 0`)
});
```
```javascript Query in app context (poor performance)
'use strict';
({params, imports}) => {
    return params.db.objects('Individual')
        .filter((individual) => individual.voided === false && _.some(individual.enrolments, (enrolment) => enrolment.program.name === 'Child'))
};
```

For using the filters in the rules also check section on Dashboard Card Rule here - [Writing rules](doc:writing-rules)

## Performance of queries

The report cards requires one to return a list individuals. This can be done by:

1. Performing db.objects on Individual and filtering them down.
2. Performing db.objects on descendants of Subject (like encounter, enrolment), filter them down, then return list of Individuals from each filtered object. Example is given below.

## Implementation Patterns for writing performant queries

Please refer to [this reference for Realm Query Language](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/device-sdks/realm-query-language/).

To understand difference between filter and filtered that is referred below, please see, <https://avni.readme.io/docs/writing-rules#difference-between-filter-and-filtered>

Please also get in touch with platform team if you identify a new pattern and a new type of requirement where none of the following fits.

1. Filter based on chronological data
   1. The matching has to be done on specific chronological descendant entity. e.g. `first` encounter of a specific type, `recent` encounter of specific type.
   2. In this case performing `db.objects` on Individual will lead to either very complex queries or will demand performing filtering in memory using JS.
   3. In this case one can do `db.objects` on descendant entity and then use something like `.filtered('TRUEPREDICATE sort(programEnrolment.individual.uuid asc , encounterDateTime desc) Distinct(programEnrolment.individual.uuid)')` to get the chronological relevant entity at the top in each group. Distinct keyword picks only the first entity in the sorted group.
   4. After performing `filtered`, one can return Subjects by performing `list.map(enc => enc.programEnrolment.individual)`
2. Filter based exact observation value
   1. Matching observations by loading them in memory and calling JS functions will lead to slower reports.
   2. A combination of `subquery` and realm query based match will have much better performance. For example: matching observation that has a specific value - `SUBQUERY(observations, $observation, $observation.concept.name = 'Phone number' and $observation.valueJSON CONTAINS '7555795537'`
3. Filter based on exact specific coded observation value
   1. Matching coded value using its name will require one to load data in memory and perform the match. But this could result in sub-optimal performance. Hence the readability of the report should be sacrificed here for performance.
   2. The query will be like `SUBQUERY(observations, $observation, $observation.concept.uuid = 'Marital Status' and $observation.valueJSON CONTAINS 'fb1080b4-d1ec-4c87-a10d-3838ba9abc5b'`
   3. Please note here that multiple observations can be matched here using OR, AND etc.
4. Filter based on a custom observation value expression.
   1. Instead of matching against a single value match using numeric expression. e.g. match BMI greater than 20.0.
   2. This kind of match cannot be done using realm query and implementing them in JS may result in poor performance.
   3. In such cases we should find out the significance of magic number 20.0. Usually we also have a coded decision observation associated that has meaning behind 20.0, like malnutrition status, BMI Status etc. If there is one then we should match against that using pattern 3 above. If such observation is not present then consider adding them to decisions.
   4. In requirements where such associated coded observation are not present and cannot be added, the performance will depend on the number of observations and entities being matched. If this number is large the performance is expected to be slow, it is better to avoid making reports, or move such reports to their own dashboard - so that they don't impact the usability of other reports.

### Detailed examples

#### DEPRECATED: Avoid using generic functions:

- The following is deprecated cause we should use `Filter based on chronological data` pattern from above.
- To find observation of a concept avoid using the function `findLatestObservationInEntireEnrolment` unless absolutely necessary since it searches for the observation in all encounters and enrolment observations. Use specific functions.
- Eg: To find observation in enrolment can use the function `enrolment.findObservation` or to find observations in specific encounter type can get the encounters using `enrolment.lastFulfilledEncounter(...encounterTypeNames)` and then find observation. Refer code examples for the below 3 usecases.
- ```text Usecase 1
  Find children with birth weight less than 2. Birth weight is captured in enrolment

      };

          .filter((individual) => _.some(individual.enrolments, enrolment => enrolment.program.name === 'Child' && _.isNil(enrolment.programExitDateTime) && !enrolment.voided && isLowBirthWeight(enrolment)))

  ```

#### Based on the use case decide whether to write the logic using realm query or JS.

- Not always achieving the purpose using realm queries might be efficient/possible. 

  - **DEPRECATED** cause we should use `Filter based on chronological data` pattern from above. Eg: consider a use case where a mandatory concept is used in a program encounter. Now to check the latest value of the concept, its sufficient to check the last encounter and need not iterate all encounters. Since realm subquery doesn't support searching only in the last encounter, for such usecases, using realm queries not only becomes slow and also sometimes inappropriate depending on the usecase. So in such cases, using JS code for the logic, is more efficient. (refer the below code example)

    - ```Text Usecase
      Find dead children using concept value captured in encounter cancel or program exit form.
      ```
      ```javascript Recommended way
      'use strict';
      ({params, imports}) => { 
         const moment = imports.moment;

         const isChildDead = (enrolment) => {
            const exitObservation = enrolment.findExitObservation('29238876-fbd8-4f39-b749-edb66024e25e');
            if(!_.isNil(exitObservation) && _.isEqual(exitObservation.getValueWrapper().getValue(), "cbb0969c-c7fe-4ce4-b8a2-670c4e3c5039"))
              return true;
            
            const encounters = enrolment.getEncounters(false);
            const sortedEncounters = _.sortBy(encounters, (encounter) => {

  - Please also refer to `Filter based on a custom observation value expression` pattern above, before using this. Consider another use case, where observations of numeric concepts need to be compared. This is not possible to achieve via realm query since the solution would involve the need for JSON parsing of the stored observation. Hence JS logic is appropriate here. (refer below code example)

## Nested Report Cards

Frequently there are cases where across report cards very similar logic is used and only a value used for comparison, changes. Eg: in one of our partner organisations, we load 'Total SAM children' and 'Total MAM children'. For rendering each takes around 20-30s. And hence the dashboard nos doesn't load until both the report card results are calculated and it makes the user to wait for a minute. If the logic is combined, we can render the results in 30s since it would need only retrieval from db and iterating once.  
The above kind of scenarios also lead to code duplication across report cards and when some requirement changes, then the change needs to be done in both.

In-order to handle such scenarios, we recommend using the Nested Report Card. This is a non-standard report card, which has the ability to show upto a maximum of **9** report cards, based on a single Query's response.

The query can return an object with "reportCards" property, which holds within it an array of objets with properties, ` { cardName: 'nested-i', cardColor: '#123456', textColor: '#654321', primaryValue: '20', secondaryValue: '(5%)',  lineListFunction: () => {/*Do something*/} }`. DB instance is passed using the params and useful libraries like lodash and moment are available in the imports parameter of the function. 

```javascript Nested Report Card Query Format
