This feature allows users to jump directly to any page in the form and then quickly save the form skipping the middle questions. This will save a lot of time as now users don't have to go through all the pages.  
There is no configuration required for the quick form edit feature however, one need to enable jump to summary feature

## Enabling jump to summary

In the admin app go to "Organisation Details" and enable the "Show summary button" option.
