Implementers can provide the custom background color and text color to the page header(form element group). Although the implementer can choose from any color present in the color palette, we suggest choosing the contrast colors for the background and text so that the page header is visible properly.

Background and text color can be chosen from the option available at the bottom of each page. Once the colors are chosen and the form is saved, it'll be visible in the observation table in the subject dashboard and also while filling the form.
