## Purpose

- Prepare data in bulk, review, and upload.
- Migrating away from an existing implementation, and need to seed with existing data.
- Your organization has a separate component where data is collected outside Avni, but you still need this data to be present with field workers using Avni.

## Using the Admin app to upload data

The Admin app of the web console has an upload option. Currently, this supports the following. Essentially for each form present in you organisation there is a corresponding upload option in the dropdown, with a sample file.

- Upload subjects
- Upload program enrolment (excluding exit information and observations)
- Upload program encounters (excluding cancel information and observations)
- Upload encounters (excluding cancel information and observations)
- [Upload locations](location-and-catchment-in-avni)
- Upload users and catchments
- Upload metadata zip file downloaded from a different implementation

## Sample file

Sample files are available in the interface. Download the file, fill in values and then upload. The file is in a [CSV](https://www.howtogeek.com/348960/what-is-a-csv-file-and-how-do-i-open-it/) format.  
Sample file acts as an up-to-date documentation on the following.

- fields
- whether they are mandatory for upload
- possible values
- format of the value

> 📘 Since above has already been documented and maintain in the sample file these are not documented here again, please refer to it as a reference documentation.

## Mandatory fields in the form

The mandatory fields in the form element are not applicable when uploading the data via CSV files - since we have seen when made mandatory especially for the legacy data, the users are force to upload some junk information (this may be added in the future).

## Rules

No rules are run as part of CSV upload. This implies that:

- field values created automatically via form element rules will not get created (such columns are present in the sample hence can be uploaded manually)
- observations created by decision rules will not be created automatically (such columns are present in the sample hence can be uploaded manually)
- Validation rule is not applied
- Edit rule is not applied

> 📘 Avni currently doesn't have a robust framework to run these rules on the server side. This may be added in future, if we observe that users need these.

## Identifiers

The primary purpose of these identifiers is for the users to be able to link different CSV file types upload data to each  other - in the same way as foreign key linkages between different records. These linkages can be created using identifiers of user's choosing. Lets try to understand this via an example. Lets assume there are three forms.

- Woman Registration (Subject)
- Pregnancy Program Enrolment (Program Enrolment)
  - links to woman
- Ante Natal Visit Form (Program Encounter)
  - links to pregnancy program

> 📘 The identifiers used above, for Id from previous system, are saved in Avni but is not visible in Avni after uploading, it is used only for matching records during CSV upload.

## Scheduling a visit and Upload visit details

Please note that sample file for uploading visit details and scheduling a visit are different. These two options allow for  either creating a scheduled encounter/visit or completed encounter/visit. Note that scheduling a visit and then uploading the visit details for the same visit is not supported (as that is similar to edit).

## Important Notes / Gotchas

- **Limited Concept Support in CSV Upload**: Not all concepts are supported when uploading data via CSV. Specifically, the following are not supported:
  - GroupAffiliation
  - Id
  - File
- **Id Confusion**: The identifiers (used in Id from previous system) are different from Id elements in the form, if you have them.
- **Form Data Editing**: Editing previously submitted form data is not currently supported through the CSV upload process.

# Questions

### What if I have a comma in my observation value?

- Wrap your value in quotes.

### Why are decision concepts not appearing the sample file

If you are using decision concepts in the rule but not linked those concepts then this will happen.

### Is the order of values important?

- No. Columns can be in any order.

### How do I upload images?

- For images, use a url that the avni server can download. Ensure that
  - The images are a direct download link (not a redirect to a page that uses javascript to download)
  - The image urls end with the image type. eg: <https://somedomain.com/images/abc.png>
