We are listing down some criteria which could help you in deciding which device to choose. The price range kept in this analysis is between 7000 to 10000 Indian Rupees.

**OS Version**: While Avni will work on version >= 5.0, but if you are purchasing a new device then it is better to go for a more recent version. Realistically though setting the bar too high will reduce your options. Hence we recommend version >= 11.

**RAM**: Primary memory >= 4 GB is minimum requirement for quick response during app launch or screen transitions. Recommend devices with memory >= 6GB.

**CPU Speed**: Minimum requirement is a 64-bit ARM processor, with atleast 4 cores clocked at 2.0 GHz. Recommend Octa-core devices clocked at >= 2.0 GHz.

**Storage**: >= 64 GB is required for ensuring Phone OS version and all installed app versions are up to date, while retaining enough space to store media content for extended period of time.

**SD Card**: Avni in future may allow for keeping an additional backup of the data on the SD card. This is to protect against corruption of main data on internal storage which is not completely synced up with the server. Required only if your device has less than 64GB of Storage on itself.

**Screen Size**: For users who will use the application quite often, we recommend 6 inches as ideal, also considering the ability to carry it. You can, of course, go for higher or lower based on your preference.

**Camera**: A minimum of a 8MP camera will be required for good resolution images of the field work. Higher is also fine, but keep in mind that, the higher resolution requires more network bandwidth to upload. The storage of device will also need to support.

**Network Support**: Avni just needs a network connection. It could even work on 2G connectivity, but again, given that you are buying a new device go for devices which can work with 4G networks. Devices with 5G support are also fine, if they are tuned to work with 4G networks in low network availability scenarios. 

**Battery Life**: Once you have multiple devices that you can compare, look for their mAh rating. Higher is better.
