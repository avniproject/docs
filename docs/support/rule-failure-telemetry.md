## About rule failure

Avni doesn't stop the users from using the app and filling the forms when the rules triggered fail. These errors get stored on the mobile device's database and then posted to the server as part of the sync process. Only if the Sync completes successfully, do the RuleFailureTelemetry entries on the mobile device get cleaned-up, otherwise, the keep getting created as duplicates as part of every sync there onwards. This behaviour is to ensure, we do not loose RuleFailures before they are successfully synced to the backend server and stored in primary Database.

The app designer displays these errors from the Rule Failures tab. On clicking a RuleFailure entry, the errorMessage details are visible. These can be also closed from there, by selecting corresponding CheckBoxes and clicking on "CLOSE ERRORS" button.
