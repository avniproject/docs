The Data Entry App, as the name suggests, is used to view and enter data directly without relying on mobile syncing. It can be accessed by clicking on the 'Data Entry app' tile in the home page.

### Advantages:

- **Instant access**: When you are on a computer with internet access, you can view and enter data without downloading or syncing data like in the mobile app.
- **Larger data coverage**: On the mobile app, the maximum number of catchment locations that can be synced is 65,535. If you need to view data across more locations, the Data Entry App can be used.
