### Showing Sync Status

This may be required any entity originating in Avni and then pushed to the other integrated system. The user may want to know whether the entity has been synced to the other system.

- The end user of Avni shouldn't be bothered with the technical status of any data. They should assume that it has been sent where ever it is meant to be sent. If not sent then the support and administration team will handle it.
- The administrator should also assume everything is synced successfully unless it is present in the error records.
- These are likely use cases relevant for development phase of the integration.
