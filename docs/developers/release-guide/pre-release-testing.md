## One time

- Create a new (permanent) user pool called pre-release
- Create users in the same pool for each implementation, with the right organization

## Prepare a new replicated environment

- Replicate production environment and create a temporary environment called pre-release. Following are the steps to do this:

1. Go to infra repo.
2. Update minor\_version file at the path "server/version/minor_version" with the latest version that you need to deploy. You can get last successful version from "build" job of openchs-server workflow from CircleCI.
3. Run `make plan-prerelease-from-prod`.
4. Create prerelease environment using command `make create-prerelease-from-prod`.
5. Check prerelease server logs to make sure that server has started. 
6. Also make sure from the logs that all migrations have run successfully. 
7. **Warning**: If any migration is failing or taking too long make sure to fix the issue and please don't manually make the server skip a migration. Skipped migration will result in headache during the prod release. 

## Deployment

- Deploy new server build
- Deploy core metadata.
- Deploy all the implementations that you are going to deploy on Production. 
- **Warning**: If you miss out deploying any implementation then you lose the chance to catch errors that may come during prod release.

## Test existing app with existing implementations

- Build the version of the app corresponding to the one available on the play store on your machine or circle-ci pointing to pre-release.
- Use this app. Perform sync. Test the app.

## Test new app with existing/new implementations

- Update the app on the device you are testing
- Test the app for each implementation (Uninstall, Install, Login, Any other testing)
- Ensure that you have run the "Run Rules" if required during the testing for the new customer. 

## Finally

- You are good to go for production release if there are no issues.
- Stop/Destroy the pre-release environment
- Right now, the make task to stop/destroy pre-release env, in infra code base is not fully functional. So terminate EC2 and delete prerelease db from RDS. Be careful while doing it.
